# <Horiseon Refactoring>
## Description
For this project, I refactored the existing code for Horiseonâ€™s website to improve its accessibility and functionality. While mostly functional, its code did not contain semantic html elements or alt attributes and contained repetitive CSS selectors. This website also did not have a functioning link for the Search Engine Optimization option.

## Credits
Before turning this project in, I checked over my work with a tutor in the UofU Bootcamp tutoring program named Carlin Shaw. Our session was very helpful and informative and contributed to my decision to use the HTML tags article and aside.
